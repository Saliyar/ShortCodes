abstract = {This research deals with the validation of fluid dynamic models, used for simulating shoaling and breaking solitary waves on slopes, based on experiments performed at the Ecole Sup{\'{e}}rieure d'Ing{\'{e}}nieurs de Marseille's (ESIM) laboratory. A separate paper, also presented at this conference, reports on experiments. In a first part of this work, a fully nonlinear potential flow model based on a Boundary Element Method (BEM) developed at the University of Rhode Island (URI), is used to generate and propagate solitary waves over a slope, up to overturning, in a set-up closely reproducing the laboratory tank geometry and wavemaker system. The BEM model uses a boundary integral equation method for the solution of governing potential flow equations and an explicit Lagrangian time stepping for time integration. In a second part, several Navier-Stokes (NS) models, developed respectively at TREFLE-ENSCPB, IMFT, IRPHE and LSEET are initialized based on the BEM solution and used for modeling breaking solitary waves in a finely discretized region encompassing the top of the slope and the surfzone. The NS models are based on the Volume of Fluid Method (VOF). This paper mostly deals with the first part, which includes calibration and comparison of BEM results with experiments, for the generation of solitary waves in the physical wave tank. Thus, parameters of the physical wave tank were numerically matched, including tank geometry and motion of the wavemaker paddle corresponding to the generation of solitary waves. Use and coupling of the BEM and VOF models for the simulation of solitary wave breaking is discussed in the 306 paper.

abstract = {The present paper and its companion (Higuera et al., 2012) introduce OpenFOAM{\textregistered} as a tool to consider for coastal engineering applications as it solves 3D domains and considers two-phase flow. In this first paper, OpenFOAM{\textregistered} utilities are presented and the free surface flow solvers are analysed. The lack of specific boundary conditions for realistic wave generation is overcome with their implementation combined with active wave absorption. Wave generation includes all the widely used theories plus specific piston-type wavemaker replication. Also standalone active wave absorption implementation is explained for several formulations, all of which are applicable to 3D cases. Active wave absorption is found to enhance stability by decreasing the energy of the system and to correct the increasing water level on long simulations. Furthermore, it is advantageous with respect to dissipation zones such as sponge layers, as it does not increase the computational domain. The results vary depending on the theory (2D, Quasi-3D and 3D) but overall performance of the implemented methods is very good. The simulations and results of the present paper are purely theoretical. Comparisons with laboratory data are presented in the second paper (Higuera et al., 2012). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

New modules have been further extended to advance the wave generation and wave absorbing capabilities of the code. The numerical results for wave interactions with a vertical surface piercing cylinder have been compared with physical experiments performed at Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI). Comparisons between the numerical results and the measured data for three regular waves and four focused wave groups, have indicated that OpenFOAM is very capable of accurate modelling of nonlinear wave interaction with offshore structures, with up to 4th order harmonic correctly captured.

abstract = {An interactive zonal numerical method has been developed for the prediction of free surface flows around surface-piercing bodies, including both viscous and nonlinear wave effects. In this study, a Laplace solver for potential flow body-wave problems is used in conjunction with a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method for accurate resolution of viscous, nonlinear free surface flows around a vertical strut and a series 60 ship hull. The Laplace equation for potential flow is solved in the far field to provide the nonlinear waves generated by the body. The RANS method is used in the near field to resolve the turbulent boundary layers, wakes, and nonlinear waves around the body. Both the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions are satisfied on the exact free surface to ensure accurate resolution of the divergent and transverse waves. The viscousinviscid interaction between the potential flow and viscous flow regions is captured through a direct matching of the velocity and pressure fields in an overlapping RANS and potential flow computational region. The numerical results demonstrate the capability of an interactive RANS/Laplace coupling method for accurate and efficient resolution of the body boundary layer, the viscous wake, and the nonlinear waves induced by surfacepiercing bodies. {\textcopyright}ASCE.},

The strategy couples a boundary element method with a Navier-Stokes solver combined with a level-set technique for the tracking of the interface. The former is used in the fluid region where the interface can be modelled as a smooth surface. In the rest of the domain the field solver is applied. This results in an efficient and accurate method. In this paper, the features of the used strategy are described and the challenges connected with the coupling are deeply discussed. The numerical investigation highlighted the importance of a proper rational study when CFD methods are considered. In the present case, a crucial aspect is represented by the domain-composition step, that is when the information from one solver to the other have to be properly reconstructed and made consistent with the receiver sub-domain.

The laminar interactions of a pair of vortex tubes with a clean free surface at intermediate Froude and Weber numbers and a low Reynolds number show two distinct phases. During the rise phase of the vortex pairs, instabilities lead to the formation of helical vorticity. The rotation of the helical vorticity around the primary vortex tubes causes an unsteady oscillation in the free-surface elevation. During the reconnection phase, the helical vortex sheets get narrower and attach themselves to the free surface. The normal connections of cross-axis vorticity with the free surface give whirls.

abstract = {The principle of velocity decomposition is used to combine field discretization and boundary-element techniques to solve for steady, viscous, external flows around bodies. The decomposition modifies the Navier-Stokes boundary-value problem and produces a Laplace problem for a viscous potential, and a new Navier-Stokes sub-problem that can be solved on the portion of the domain where the total velocity has rotation. The key development in the decomposition is the formulation for the boundary condition on the viscous potential that couples the two components of velocity. An iterative numerical scheme is described to solve the decomposed problem. Results are shown for the steady laminar flow over a sectional airfoil, a circular cylinder with separation, and the turbulent flow around a slender body-of-revolution. The results show the viscous potential is obtainable even for massively separated flows, and the field discretization must only encompass the vortical region of the total velocity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {A velocity decomposition method is developed for the solution of three-dimensional, unsteady flows. The velocity vector is decomposed into an irrotational component (viscous-potential velocity) and a vortical component (vortical velocity). The vortical velocity is selected so that it is zero outside of the rotational region of the flow field and the flow in the irrotational region can thus be solely described by the viscous-potential velocity. The formulation is devised to employ both the velocity potential and the Navier–Stokes-based numerical methods such that the field discretization required by the Navier–Stokes solver can be reduced to only encompass the rotational region of the flow field and the number of unknowns that are to be solved by the Navier–Stokes solver is greatly reduced. A higher-order boundary-element method is used to solve for the viscous potential by applying a viscous boundary condition to the body surface. The finite-volume method is used to solve for the total velocity on a reduced domain, using the viscous-potential velocity as the boundary condition on the extent of the domain. The two solution procedures are tightly coupled in time. The viscous-potential velocity and the total velocity are time dependent due to the unsteadiness in the boundary layer and the wake. The solver is applied to solve three-dimensional, laminar and turbulent unsteady flows. For turbulent flows, the solver is applied for both Unsteady-Reynolds-Averaging-Navier–Stokes and Large-Eddy-Simulation computations.},

@article{Janssen2010,
abstract = {In this work, we report on the development and initial validation of a new hybrid numerical model for strongly nonlinear free surface flows, including wave breaking and wave-structure interactions. Specifically, a two-dimensional numerical wave tank (NWT) based on Fully Nonlinear Potential Flow (FNPF) theory, and a higher-order Boundary Element Method (BEM), is used to simulate fully nonlinear wave generation and far-field propagation over a possibly complex, but generally sloping, bottom bathymetry. A particle-based Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is coupled with (or nested within) the FNPF-NWT, in the region where breaking would normally occur (e.g., upper part of a slope) and interrupt FNPF simulations. The coupled model is able to capture breaking and post-breaking (or wave-interaction) phenomena that involve more complex physics than represented by FNPF theory. Turbulence, in particular, is represented in the LB model by a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) scheme, based on a Smagorinsky model. In applications, we first validate the model for a one-way weakly coupled scheme, in which the LB model is initialized in the near-field, and then possibly driven on its boundary, by the wave-induced far-field velocity and pressure and their derivatives, computed within the NWT. In the paper, we formulate a fully (or strongly) coupled approach, in which the flow is first decomposed into irrotational and viscous perturbation parts. The latter lead to new terms that, by analogy with Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, are expressed as volume forces, that drive LB simulations of the perturbation fields. Applications of this strong coupling approach will be presented at the conference. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

abstract = {This paper presents recent offshore applications of the SWENSE (Spectral Wave Explicit Navier-Stokes Equations) approach which is an original solution scheme for the time simulation of wave-body interactions using a combined potential / RANSE approach and a decomposition of the nonlinear flow in incident and diffracted parts. The viscous free surface flow around an TLP is computed in cases of regular and irregular waves. The incoming regular wave field is given by an algorithm based on stream function theory (Rienecker {\&} Fenton, 1981) while the incoming irregular wave field is computed by a Higher Order Spectral (HOS) model (Bonnefoy et al, 2004). This latter model is validated against the previous one for a case of regular waves. Concerning results on the TLP structure, time histories of free surface elevations and pressure loads are compared to results from a time domain nonlinear potential flow solver (Ferrant, 1996; Ferrant et al, 2003b). Results obtained with the SWENSE method show an overall good agreement with second order potential flow results. Essential non linear effects associated with the interaction with the free surface are captured, while noticeable viscous effects are also observed, in the form of vortices shed by pontoons corners. More in-depth comparisons with experimental or numerical data have to be undertaken but these preliminary results are a good indication of the capacity of the SWENSE scheme for simulating wave-body interactions in the offshore context.

abstract = {A computational method for steady water waves is presented on the basis of potential theory in the physical plane with spatial variables as independent quantities. The finite Fourier series are applied to approximating the free surface and potential function. A set of nonlinear algebraic equations for the Fourier coefficients are derived from the free surface kinetic and dynamic boundary conditions. These algebraic equations are numerically solved through Newton's iterative method, and the iterative stability is further improved by a relaxation technology. The integral properties of steady water waves are numerically analyzed, showing that (1) the set-up and the set-down are both non-monotonic quantities with the wave steepness, and (2) the Fourier spectrum of the free surface is broader than that of the potential function. The latter further leads us to explore a modification for the present method by approximating the free surface and potential function through different Fourier series, with the truncation of the former higher than that of the latter. Numerical tests show that this modification is effective, and can notably reduce the errors of the free surface boundary conditions. {\textcopyright} The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract = {A numerical framework for coupling arbitrary potential flow with fully nonlinear, two–phase and turbulent Computational Fluid Dynamics model is presented in this work, where the primary focus of this thesis is the development of viscous model. The model is implemented in arbitrary polyhedral Finite Volume method in foam–extend, a community driven fork of the open source Open Field Operation And Manipulation software. The present model relies on the Ghost Fluid Method for discretisation of jump conditions, yielding infinitesimally sharp density and pressure jumps across the free surface. Interface capturing is achieved with implicitly redistanced Level Set method derived from the Phase Field equation, yielding good conservation prop- erties and rendering additional redistancing steps unnecessary. The potential and viscous flow coupling is achieved via Spectral Wave Explicit Navier–Stokes Equa- tions approach, where the solution is decomposed into incident potential flow so- lution and perturbation components, facilitating wave transport. Wave reflection is prevented by using relaxation zones with implicit treatment in the far–field. All methodologies are mathematically or numerically reformulated to adhere to strongly conservative, compact stencil, polyhedral Finite Volume method. The numerical model is validated and verified on four sets of test cases: free surface flow over a ramp, wave propagation, assessment of higher order forces on a vertical cylinder due to wave diffraction and seakeeping of a ship in head and oblique regular waves. The computational results compare well with analytical, other numerical and experimental results. A strong emphasis is given to numer- ous sensitivity studies addressing numerical uncertainties.

abstract = {The present paper and its companion present a solution and domain decomposition model for general two-phase, incompressible and turbulent flows encountered in naval hydrodynamics. The mathematical and numerical model are derived within the framework of polyhedral finite volume method. Interface capturing is obtained with implicitly redistanced level set method derived from the phase field equation. This approach removes the need to redistance the level set field, thus saving CPU time and increasing numerical stability. A modified, Spectral Wave Explicit Navier-Stokes Equations method is introduced and used for wave modelling, where the solution is decomposed into incident and perturbation fields. The incident field is readily available from potential flow theories, and only the perturbation component is solved within the non-linear equation set of the free surface flow model. The domain is decomposed with implicit relaxation zones used to prevent wave reflection by forcing the perturbation fields to vanish in the far-field. A second-order, collocated finite volume method is used to discretise the equations. All equations are solved implicitly, which enables the use of higher Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy numbers compared to explicit scheme. The algorithm is implemented in foam-extend-3.1, a community driven fork of the OpenFOAM CFD software. Verification and validation of the model is presented in the accompanying paper.},

The NWT is based on a nonlinear model using the High-Order Spectral (HOS) method, which exhibits high level of accuracy as well as efficiency properties provided by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) solution. The wavemaker modeling appears to be a key point in the simulation and it is carefully detailed. Different levels of approximation of the wave generation (up to third-order in nonlinearity) are studied. The properties of the numerical scheme in terms of convergence, stability and accuracy are discussed. This NWT features all the characteristics of the real wave tank (directional wavemaker, absorbing zone, perfectly reflective side walls). Furthermore, several validation results and practical applications where numerical simulations are successfully compared to experiments on 2D and 3D wave fields are presented."

abstract = {We report an experimental study of the reconstruction of real-ocean rogue waves in a laboratory environment using the time reversal (TR) methodology (Chabchoub {\&} Fink, Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 112, 2014, 124101). Three different rogue wave measurements are used to validate the TR approach. The generation and accurate control of target free-surface profiles in a unidirectional wave flume using standard techniques, such as the New Wave theory (Tromans, Anaturk {\&} Hagemeier, Proceedings of the First International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference, 1991, pp. 64-71), are fairly challenging, especially for very steep and, thus, highly nonlinear extreme waves. The TR method, making use of the time reversibility of wave propagation and symmetry of the governing hydrodynamic equations of motion, leads to a simple two-step experimental procedure, the accuracy of which is investigated in this paper. The use of the TR procedure requires the appropriate Froude scaling in designing the model-scale experiments. The present study represents the first validation of the TR method to realistic irregular seas containing rogue waves. Three extreme wave profiles are tested to assess the applicability of the TR scheme to different wave configurations taking into account variable characteristics. This includes the famed New Year wave. The accuracy of the TR method is demonstrated with varying wave steepness values and propagation distances of the reverse reconstruction. It is demonstrated that the unidirectional TR reconstruction is robust, even in the presence of unavoidable wave breaking, known to be an irreversible process within the framework of any wave hydrodynamic evolution equation, and independently of complex environmental conditions or focusing mechanism at play in the sea.},

abstract = {Wave generation solvers using Higher Order Spectral Method (HOS) have been validated and developed over the years. HOS solves nonlinear wave propagation in open sea (HOS-Ocean) and in numerical wave tank (HOS-NWT) with low computation time comparing with other nonlinear solvers. HOS solvers are released as open-source codes under the terms of GNU General Public Licence (GPLv3). Nonlinear irregular wave generation in computational fluids dynamic (CFD) solvers becomes important recently in naval fiels to better estimate the loads on offshore structure. The conventional linear superposition methods imply a long computational time for wave generation and the simulation is made almost impossible without having enough computational power. And if the method is based on linear wave theory, there is also question on occurence of nonlinear phenomenon and the interaction between waves as the simulation goes. Therefore dedicated nonlinear wave solvers with high computational speed are needed. Grid2Grid is developed as a wrapper program of HOS to generate wave fields from the results of HOS computation. Grid2Grid reconstructs wave fields of HOS with inverse fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and uses a quick spline module, the nonlinear wave fields can be fastly reconstructed for arbitrary simulation time and space. The nonlinear wave simulation is then possible for a particular position and time where specific non linear phenomenon occur.

abstract = {A two-way coupling methodology for wave propagation and wave-structure interaction with SPH is hereby presented. The methodology consists of combining a fast, fully non-linear wave propagation model, OceanWave3D, with an accurate Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solver, DualSPHysics. At the coupling interface in the SPH zone, moving dynamic boundary particles are applied, which move according to the horizontal velocity calculated in the wave propagation model. The surface elevation is registered in the SPH zone and transferred back to the wave propagation model. Using this coupling methodology, a large domain can be simulated with the wave propagation model, with small, discrete SPH zones embedded to locally obtain higher accuracies. The communication between the solvers is implemented using OpenMPI. Three connected processes are run: OceanWave3D, DualSPHysics and Python. The latter is used to monitor the data transfer and manipulate the data in an efficient manner. The coupling methodology is validated by simulating wave propagation of linear and non-linear waves, and comparing the surface elevations and orbital velocities to a theoretical solution. Comparison with two experimental datasets is performed as well. The coupling methodology proofs that it is able to accurately propagate waves and shows a good agreement with theoretical and experimental results.},

The two models are strongly coupled in space and time domains using a moving overlapping zone, wherein the information from both the solvers is exchanged. In the time domain, the Runge-Kutta 2nd order method is nested with a predictor-corrector scheme. In the space domain, numerical techniques including 'Feeding Particles' and two-layer particle interpolation with relaxation coefficients are introduced to achieve the robust coupling of the two models. The properties and behaviours of the new hybrid model are tested by modelling a regular wave, solitary wave and Cnoidal wave including breaking and overtopping. It is validated by comparing the results of the method with analytical solutions, results from other methods and experimental data. The paper demonstrates that the method can produce satisfactory results but uses much less computational time compared with a method based on the full NS model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper first presents a comparison particularly in terms of accuracy between four nonlinear potential flow models for simulation of nonlinear free surface water waves. The performance of the wave models is compared in five test cases in 2D for which measurement data was also available. Three cases involved wave groups propagating over a flat bottom and producing a focusing event, and two cases involved irregular waves propagating over sloping bottom. After the comparison study, one of the potential flow solvers was selected for one-way coupling with a viscous flow solver. Details of this coupling are presented along with some information about the viscous flow solver in question. Here strong suits of both solvers are utilized to simulate nonlinear water waves in an accurate and efficient manner. Even though only simulating nonlinear waves is discussed in the paper, this work was considered as a stepping stone to later focus on hydrodynamic wave loading on structures and wave-structure interaction using this coupling. In the end results showed that such a coupling can indeed be a valuable tool to study wave motion. In all the simulations, comparison with the measurements demonstrated good agreement, and the convergence behavior of the coupled solver was acceptable.},

Several test cases are conducted, in which coupled simulations are compared to both shallow water simulations and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. It is shown that shallow water waves traverse the interface between both regions without significant distortion. For a complex scenario of a flood wave approaching an obstacle, it is demonstrated that the method is computationally efficient and that it is stable and accurate even in cases where basic assumptions of the shallow water equations are violated.},

Nevertheless, it is often required for a proper assessment of coastal safety and design of coastal defences. However to study the wave propagation from deep ocean to nearshore is difficult using a single model because multiple scales are present both in time and in space. The present study proposes the use of two different models to generate and propagate the wave field from offshore to nearshore locations. The work aims to develop a technique for the assessment of the action of sea waves on the coast starting from predicted incident wave conditions offshore. Hence a hybrid method has been developed that couples the capabilities of a wave propagation model, SWASH, and a meshfree particle method, DualSPHysics.},

Sediment transport in front of the structure as well as the wave structure interactions are simulated with the open-source CFD software OpenFOAM. Wave propagation over the beach until the wave breaking point is modelled with SWASH, a model based on the non-linear shallow water equations in order to limit the computational cost. A one-way coupling methodology between these two models is proposed. The capability of OpenFOAM as stand-alone model to accurately predict wave loading forces on buildings for a case with a very shallow foreshore is demonstrated by comparing the numerical results to experimental data. The ability of OpenFOAM to simulate scour processes is validated by experimental data of a submerged jet flow over an apron. Furthermore, a first test case with the coupled OpenFOAM-SWASH model presenting the propagation of regular waves is described.},

abstract = {A hybrid 2D-3D CFD model is developed for studying water wave loads on a slender pile in a pile group. In the hybrid model approach, a one-way link is established between a model for the far-field and another for studying the fluid-structure interaction in the near field. In the far-field a 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes multiphase solver is considered for the proper reproduction of phase-focused (freak) waves produced in physical experiments. The near-field model is a multiphase 3D CFD model that utilizes compressible Navier-Stokes equations to enhance the simulation of entrapped air compressibility effects during breaking wave impact on structures. Both models use the Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method to capture the air-water interface and alternatively a RANS or LES turbulence model. An overlap zone is introduced to both models, in which fluid kinematics and surface elevation are sampled from the far-field model and introduced via a relaxation function to the overlap zone in the near-field model. In the 3D model, the use of a relaxation approach provides absorption for reflected waves from the structure. Further, a procedure is outlined to achieve/enhance the 3D model convergence. This is necessary in case of the development of artificial high velocities at water-air interface at the end of a short overlap (relaxation) zone for wave inlet (or near the boundary if only a wave inlet boundary condition is considered). The model system is developed using the OpenFOAM{\textregistered}1 framework. The overlap zone is implemented as an extension to the waves2Foam [1] toolbox.},

abstract = {We present a multi-region coupling procedure based on the finite-volume method and apply it to two-phase hydrodynamic free surface flow problems. The method combines the features of one incompressible and one compressible two-phase flow solvers to obtain a coupled system which is generally superior to either solver alone. The coupling strategy is based on a partitioned approach in which different solvers, pre-defined in different regions of the computational domain, exchange information through interfaces, i.e. areas separating these regions. The interfaces act as boundary conditions passing the information from one region to the other mimicking the finite-volume cell-to-face interpolation procedures. This results in high performance computing coupled simulations whose functionality can be further extended in order to build a generic numerical wave tank accounting for incompressible flow regions as well as compressibility and aeration effects. We select a series of preliminary benchmarks to verify this coupling procedure which includes the simulation of a hydrodynamic dam break, the propagation and reflection of regular waves, the convection of an inviscid vortex, pseudocavitation, a water column free drop in a closed tank and a plunging wave impact at a vertical wall. The obtained results agree well with exact solutions, laboratory experiments and other numerical data.},

abstract = "An interactive approach is set forth for calculating ship boundary layers and wakes for nonzero Froude number. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a small domain with edge conditions matched with those from a source-doublet Dawson method solved using the displacement body. An overview is given of both the viscous- and inviscid-flow methods, including their treatments of the free-surface boundary conditions and interaction procedures. Results are presented for the Wigley hull, including comparisons for zero and nonzero Froude number and with available experimental data and the inviscid-flow results, which validate the overall approach and enable an evaluation of the wave-boundary layer and wake interaction."
