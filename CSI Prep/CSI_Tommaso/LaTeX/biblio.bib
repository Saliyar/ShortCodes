  abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME. In order to efficiently address complex problems in hydrodynamics, the advances in the development of a new method are presented here. This method aims at finding a good compromise between computational efficiency, accuracy, and easy handling of complex geometries. The chosen method is an Explicit Cartesian Finite Volume method for Hydrodynamics (ECFVH) based on a compressible (hyperbolic) solver, with a ghost-cell method for geometry handling and a Level-set method for the treatment of biphase-flows. The explicit nature of the solver is obtained through a weakly-compressible approach chosen to simulate nearly-incompressible flows. The explicit cell-centered resolution allows for an efficient solving of very large simulations together with a straightforward handling of multi-physics. A characteristic flux method for solving the hyperbolic part of the Navier-Stokes equations is used. The treatment of arbitrary geometries is addressed in the hyperbolic and viscous framework. Viscous effects are computed via a finite difference computation of viscous fluxes and turbulent effects are addressed via a Large-Eddy Simulation method (LES). The Level-Set solver used to handle biphase flows is also presented. The solver is validated on 2-D test cases (flow past a cylinder, 2-D dam break) and future improvements are discussed.},

  abstract = {An explicit Cartesian finite volume method is currently under development in trhe LHEEA Lab. [1] [2] . These developments are based on a weakly compressible cell centered scheme where second-order accuracy is provided by using a MUSCL [3] scheme together with various limiters for the hyperbolic part. This paper deals with introducing the method retained for simulating interfacial flows with this model. Among the various Eulerian methods available for the simulation of interfacial flows, we compare the Level Set (LS) method [4] and the Accurate Conservative Level Set (ACLS) method [5] . These techniques are both based on the convection of a distance function following the velocity field. The LS method has many advantages in terms of interface description, access to interface properties (normal and curvature). Its main drawback relies on the possible lack of mass conservation. In order to address this problem, the ACLS method uses a hyperbolic tangent function instead of the distance function, ensuring a reduction of errors. In this paper, these two methods are compared, through four criteria: diffusion of the interface, mass conservation, accuracy and CPU performances.},

The Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) was developed to capture the boundary conditions at a contact discontinuity in the inviscid Euler equations and has been extended to treat more general discontinuities such as shocks, detonations, and deflagrations and compressible viscous flows. In this paper, a similar boundary condition capturing approach is used to develop a new numerical method for the variable coefficient Poisson equation in the presence of interfaces where both the variable coefficients and the solution itself may be discontinuous. This new method is robust and easy to implement even in three spatial dimensions. Furthermore, the coefficient matrix of the associated linear system is the standard symmetric matrix for the variable coefficient Poisson equation in the absence of interfaces allowing for straightforward application of standard "black box" solvers. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The free surface is modeled with the level set method based on a two-phase flow approximation, allowing for the simulation of complex phenomena such as wave breaking. The convection terms of the momentum and the level set equations are discretized with the finite difference version of the fifth-order WENO scheme. Time stepping is handled with the third-order TVD Runge–Kutta scheme. The equations are solved on a staggered Cartesian grid, with a ghost cell immersed boundary method for the treatment of irregular cells. Waves are generated at the inlet and dissipated at the numerical beach with the relaxation method. The choice of the numerical grid and discretization methods leads to excellent accuracy and stability for the challenging calculation of free surface waves. The performance of the numerical model is validated and verified through several benchmark cases: solitary wave interaction with a rectangular abutment, wave forces on a vertical cylinder, wave propagation over a submerged bar and plunging breaking waves on a sloping bed."

  abstract = {Many two-phase flows relevant to natural and industrial applications are characterized by high density ratios and high shears at the interface. These peculiarities make numerical simulations of such kind of flows still challenging. In particular, incompressible Level-Set/Volume-of-Fluid-based solvers are affected by the onset of diverging spurious velocities close to the interface. In this paper a new strategy, able to overcome these numerical instabilities, is described for staggered Cartesian grids. In order to achieve a consistent mass-momentum advection, a new auxiliary continuity equation is introduced and resolved along the momentum equations in the velocity control volumes. The mass fluxes are evaluated through the Volume-of-Fluid color function and directly used to calculate the momentum convective term. Several high-density test cases (the density ratio going from 103 to 106) are presented: the new algorithm shows significant improvements in stability and accuracy over the standard velocity based advection methods, together with a very low increase in computational time, estimated at 5{\%}÷10{\%}. Therefore, it is suitable to simulate more complex and realistic high density ratio two-phase flows, such as the       breakup of a liquid jet in cross-flow here described.},

	abstract = {Classical approximate Riemann solvers are known to be too much dissipative in the low-Mach number regime. For this reason, since the Mach number in liquids is generally very small, usual upwind schemes may provide inaccurate solutions when applied to the simulation of two-phase flows. In this paper, to circumvent this difficulty while keeping a compressible model for the description of both gas and liquid, an original accurate low-Mach scheme is introduced and theoretically studied. Extending some ideas already used for the gas dynamics system, the proposed scheme is based on a centred formulation for the pressure gradient term in the momentum equation and on the introduction of a stabilising term proportional to the pressure difference between two neighbouring cells. The scheme stability is ensured, and theoretically proved under a convective CFL-like condition, by using a semi-implicit time discretisation algorithm. Finally, the correct asymptotic behaviour of the scheme in the limit of small Mach numbers is assessed on several academic test cases.},

% Projection methods (Zhe suggestion)
@article{Brown2001,
	abstract = {This paper considers the accuracy of projection method approximations to the initial-boundary-value problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The issue of how to correctly specify numerical boundary conditions for these methods has been outstanding since the birth of the second-order methodology a decade and a half ago. It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary conditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connection between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},
